# 24-03-07 reliability improvements

# To improve the reliability of this script, you can consider the following suggestions:

# Error Handling:

# Add error handling mechanisms for each command to capture and log any errors that may occur during execution. This will help in identifying issues and troubleshooting.
# Logging:

# Instead of using Write-Output for logging, consider using Start-Transcript at the beginning of the script and Stop-Transcript at the end. This will create a log file with detailed information about the script execution.
# Conditional Execution:

# Add conditional checks after each critical step to ensure that the previous command executed successfully before proceeding to the next one. This can prevent subsequent commands from running if a failure occurs.
# Comments:

# Include comments to explain the purpose of each section or command. This will make the script more readable and help others understand its functionality.
# Timeouts:

# For commands that may take some time to complete, consider adding timeout parameters or wait mechanisms to avoid script execution delays.
# Verify Dependencies:

# Before running certain commands, check if the required dependencies are already installed or available. For example, verify if cleanmgr.exe is present before attempting to run it.
# Validation:

# Validate the success of commands that may not produce explicit error messages but could fail silently. For instance, check the return value of the Install-PackageProvider and Install-Module commands.
# Credential Security:

# If any commands require elevated privileges, ensure that the script is running with the necessary permissions. Consider using the -RunAsAdministrator flag for PowerShell, and if needed, prompt the user for credentials securely.
# Pause for User Interaction:

# Consider adding prompts or pauses where necessary, especially before executing commands that may impact the system or require user input.
# Testing:

# Test the script in a controlled environment before deploying it widely. This ensures that it behaves as expected and does not cause unintended consequences.
# By incorporating these suggestions, you can enhance the reliability of the script and make it more robust in handling various scenarios.
