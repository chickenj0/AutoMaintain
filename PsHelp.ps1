Powershell commands 

To find out which module a specific cmdlet belongs to in PowerShell, you can use the Get-Command cmdlet with the -Name parameter. Here's an example using the Get-SenderIdConfig cmdlet:

powershell
Copy code
# Use Get-Command to find the module of a specific cmdlet
(Get-Command -Name Get-SenderIdConfig).ModuleName
This will return the name of the module that contains the specified cmdlet. Once you know the module name, you can install it using the Install-Module cmdlet if it's not already installed. For example:

powershell
Copy code
# Install the required module
Install-Module -Name <ModuleName> -Force
Replace <ModuleName> with the actual name of the module you obtained from the Get-Command output.

o search for PowerShell modules related to email functionality, you can use the Find-Module cmdlet with a relevant keyword or filter. Here's an example using the keyword "email":

powershell
Copy code
# Search for modules related to email
Find-Module -Name *email*
This command will return a list of modules with names containing the term "email." You can then review the results to identify modules that might be relevant to your needs.

If you're specifically looking for modules related to email in the context of Exchange Online or Microsoft 365, you might want to use a more targeted search, such as:

powershell
Copy code
# Search for Microsoft 365 related modules
Find-Module -Name *exchange* -or *outlook* -or *office365*
Adjust the search terms based on your specific requirements. Once you identify a relevant module, you can use the Install-Module cmdlet to install it.
