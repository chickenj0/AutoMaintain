The NuGet  provider must be available in 'C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' or 'C:\Users\U R                 Safe\AppData\Local\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies'. You can also install the NuGet provider by running            'Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force'. Do you want PowerShellGet to install and import  the NuGet provider now?
