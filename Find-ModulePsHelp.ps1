# Powershell commands 
# powershell
# Copy code
# # Search for modules related to email
Find-Module -Name *email*

# This command will return a list of modules with names containing the term "email." You can then review the results to identify modules that might be relevant to your needs.

# If you're specifically looking for modules related to email in the context of Exchange Online or Microsoft 365, you might want to use a more targeted search, such as:

# powershell
# Copy code
# Search for Microsoft 365 related modules
Find-Module -Name *exchange* -or *outlook* -or *office365*

# Adjust the search terms based on your specific requirements. Once you identify a relevant module, you can use the Install-Module cmdlet to install it.
